      In mathematics, a unit circle is a circle of unit radius—that is, a radius of 1. Frequently, especially in trigonometry, the unit circle is the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin (0, 0) in the Cartesian coordinate system in the Euclidean plane. In topology, it is often denoted as S1 because it is a one-dimensional unit n-sphere.
If (x, y) is a point on the unit circle's circumference, then |x| and |y| are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle whose hypotenuse has length 1.

        The shape and the way how the unit circle is going in a counterclockwise direction, is very similar to how a day works. The sun rises from the east, which is the right hand side of the unit circle, and falls from the west. Trigonometric functions have neither a typical beginning nor end to it, and the earth will always circle around the sun. In addition, the unit circle values at certain degrees, for example, 30, 45, 60, are things we need to strictly learn from memorization. This is one of the few things that can only be learned by memory, instead of understanding. Similar to how we need to remember our daily schedules, where and what we should be doing at certain times.
